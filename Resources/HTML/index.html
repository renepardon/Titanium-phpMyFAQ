			To the Reader of this Work:
			</h3>
			
			<p>
			In submitting Captain Carter's strange manuscript to you in book form,
			I believe that a few words relative to this remarkable personality will
			be of interest.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			My first recollection of Captain Carter is of the few months he spent
			at my father's home in Virginia, just prior to the opening of the civil
			war.  I was then a child of but five years, yet I well remember the
			tall, dark, smooth-faced, athletic man whom I called Uncle Jack.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			I believe that they are waiting there for me, and something tells me
			that I shall soon know.
